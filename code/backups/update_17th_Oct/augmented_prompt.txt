Top module (Hier 0): SystolicArray_GEMM_4x4  
Description:  
Implements a 4×4 systolic array accelerator for General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using
 int16 precision.
 The design performs output-stationary accumulation, 
 optimized for low power and balanced latency–area trade-offs.
  It orchestrates data movement, computation, and 
  accumulation across a grid of Processing Elements (PEs).

Submodule (Hier 1): ArrayController  
Description:  
Manages global control of the systolic array, including sequencing of
 matrix tiles, synchronization of data streams,
 and coordination of valid-ready handshakes. It ensures correct 
 timing and flow of A, B, and C matrices through the array.

Submodule (Hier 1): InputBuffer_A  
Description:  
Stores and streams matrix A tiles into the array along rows.
 Implements a line buffer of depth 64 to feed A operands to each PE row in a pipelined fashion.

Submodule (Hier 1): InputBuffer_B  
Description:  
Stores and streams matrix B tiles into the array along columns.
 Uses a 64-depth line buffer to deliver B operands to each PE column
  while maintaining data reuse across the K dimension.

Submodule (Hier 1): OutputAccumulator_C  
Description:  
Holds partial sums for the output-stationary accumulation mode. Each PE writes 
intermediate results to this buffer, which has a depth of 2 to support pipelined
 accumulation and final write-back to memory.

Submodule (Hier 1): PE_Array_4x4  
Description:  
A 4×4 grid of Processing Elements interconnected in a systolic fashion. Each PE performs
 multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations on int16 operands,
  propagating partial results across rows and columns.

Submodule (Hier 2): ProcessingElement (PE)  
Description:  
Performs the core MAC operation: multiplies inputs from A and B streams and accumulates
 results locally. Each PE includes a 1-stage pipeline for the multiplier and adder,
  supporting output-stationary dataflow and valid-ready handshake signaling.

Submodule (Hier 1): MemoryInterface  
Description:  
Handles external memory transactions for matrices A, B, and C. 
Manages bandwidth up to 12.8 Gbps and ensures data alignment
 with the systolic array’s streaming schedule.

Submodule (Hier 1): ClockResetUnit  
Description:  
Generates and distributes the 200 MHz system clock and reset signals to all
 submodules, ensuring synchronous operation across the array and buffers.
